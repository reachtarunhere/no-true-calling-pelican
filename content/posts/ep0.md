This episode's cover art is Leonardo Da Vinci's famous Bicycle sketch from Codex Atlanticus on the backside of folio 133 ("133verso"). Da Vinci was the OG Renaissance Man who lived the idea of No True Calling throughout his lifetime. Fun fact about him - He used to steal corpses from cemeteries to create the most detailed sketches of human anatomy more than 500 years before anything of that fidelity was reproduced. We'll meet many more like him on this podcast.

The creator of this fantastic instrumental piece fits the theme of this podcast very well. He seems to be kind enough to release this track under a Creative Commons License so we could use it.
