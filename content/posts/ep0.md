Intro - "Hey everyone, This is No True Calling. I am your host Sid, together with my co-host Tarun.  No True Calling is a result of our hunger and fascination for multipotentiality, critical thinking, happiness, and a few other obsessions along the way. We have spent the last few years working with some very multidimensional individuals with many such callings! These colourful personalities continue to reinvent their lives across fields- personally, professionally, and beyond! This podcast is our attempt to share their meandering life paths in the form of deep and wide-ranging conversations. We hope that this might help YOU and us live a happier and more fulfilling life without the FOMO that comes with today’s self-improvement and hustle culture.

Enjoy listening!

S: Hey everybody, welcome to No True Calling! This is Episode Number <SIRI Zero>.

T: Okay first things first - we won’t sound like the intro on the actual podcast. Our goal it keep the conversation really relaxed and candid. So without triggering your existential crisis who are you Sid?

S: Sure, on the interwebs I mostly go by sidcode. My real life name is Sid or Siddhant for people who can pronounce it. It means principles in Sanskrit. I grew up in many different parts of India, mostly in a valley in the Himalayas. Right now, I’m living and working in Singapore as a researcher in virtual reality, cybersecurity, and design. And you, Tarun?

T: I am water <S:yeah, right!> Ironically I grew up in a pretty arid region of India. I went to BITS Pilani for my undergrad where I ran into you at one of the tech club meetings. Currently, I am a Research Engineer with a government agency in Singapore where I mostly dabble with Machine Learning applied to Language. SO, why are we here?

S: We are here to kick off our new podcast series that we adorably call  “No True Calling“

T: Besides that being your Instagram handle - what’s with the name “No True Calling”?

S: That’s one way to do a shameless plug! Incidentally, that has been my instagram handle for about 4 years now so this theme is not new to me. The name No True Calling means that there need not be one true calling in life as was the case for many prior generations. In other words, one need not restrict themselves to being a one trick pony. People are increasingly following many callings, career paths, hobbies, and this is a relatively new trend. This diverse multipotentiality is precisely what I’d love for us to explore on this show.

T: I mean I know our mutual fanboyism for Richard Feynman and Claude Shannon. So who are these other many trick ponies to you?  

S: Oh yes, we’ll get to meet a lot of them in our podcast. The beautiful thing about them is that they come from all walks of life and do many things - professionally, personally, and beyond! This podcast exists because they exist, even though they are quite sparse and challenging to find. A person I’d have really wanted as a guest would be the OG renaissance man, Leonardo Da vinci after whom we are deciding to dedicate our podcast art to.

T: But what’s wrong with being a one trick pony?

S: Nothing, guess some of us are wired for it, some less so. Life is just more fun when there are so many ways to look at it. I discovered this personally while growing up, i liked doing many different things and hobbies. I was fortunate to not only find people who share this belief, but also see them as very happy, successful, and driven in life.

I must clarify here that having many true callings does not imply a lack of purpose. In fact, one becomes a T-shaped personality - which means they have deep expertise in a few areas and they also dabble broadly in many more. Incidentally, you seem to be one such pony, which is why I think you’d make a great co-host.

T: Aww. Not all those who wander are lost. I sincerely hope. 

S: With that optimistic nihilistic undertone, what are your hopes from this podcast? 

T: While I am a complete Wozniak fanboy and not that fond of Steve Jobs - it’s one of his quotes that resonates with me hard - ”You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.” And given I can’t look forward what better way than retrace the paths people I admire took and the many callings they found on the wa Besides, it’s not just about many passions it’s about taking a path that is weird enough but kinda fun.

S: I distinctly remember that commencement speech. Steve Jobs mentioned backcasting before it was cool again now in 2019, predicting the future yet again. Typical Steve Jobs. What I especially love about multipotentialites is that they do find true callings, but are always open to learning new things without the need for optimizing their life for happiness!
So, coming back to the podcast, how are we gonna do this?

T: Every episode we’ll have a guest who we will talk to about all they do professionally and more interestingly what they do beyond. Also, there will be show notes and links to reading materials, books which are mentioned on the show. Anything else you wanna add?

S: Yep, these guests will be spread all around the world. Most of our recordings will be recorded with the guests in-person live either in Singapore or wherever we are physically travelling, like the one I recorded recently in Lithuania. The diversity of Singapore puts us in an extremely fortunate and deeply cool spot in terms of the guests and conversations we’d like to have here. One last thing, being avid podcast listeners ourselves, we will seriously respect our listeners’ times. Hence, we are making the conscious decision to cap all our episodes at about an hour by design. Longer recordings will be released as multi-part episodes. That wraps it up for this one, stay tuned for episode...
